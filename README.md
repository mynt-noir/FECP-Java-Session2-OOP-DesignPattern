**Project Title:** FECP-Java-Session2-OOP-Design Pattern / Lab 3: Java OOP Capstone Project <br>

**Brief Description of the Project:**
The project is a Java-based Hospital Billing System. The system features a menu with these key functions: <br>
- **Register Patients** - we create new patient records with a name and a unique ID. Patients initially have no availed services, which will be added on the next option.
- **Add Services** - given a Patient ID, we add their availed Services under their record.
- **Compute Bill** - given a Patient ID, we display a list of all services they have availed and calculate their total bill. We are also prompted to enter the insurance type (HMO, Senior, Cash), and we print the discounted price.
- **Exit** - exits the application.
<br>
